The region was also circumnavigated to establish its size and morphology, which revealed it to be a sphere of 100 LY radius centred on the Wolf-Rayet system Hen 2-333, which is a possible supernova candidate and is surrounded by a tiny nebula consisting of mass thrown off the central star.</p><p>It is currently unknown whether the permit lock is a result of a safety precaution or interference from astrophysical phenomena, such as extreme radiation resulting from a supernova, however the immediate vicinity of the border was discovered to have an unusual abundance of life-bearing worlds, including two systems that each harbour two Earth-like Worlds, that must all be considered endangered. </p>"

It has been in existence for over a thousand years.</p><p>By 3300 the Federation remains the largest power, holding sway over dozens of star systems within the ‘bubble’ of space known as the core worlds. It maintains a significant military force in its navy, the pinnacle of which is the ‘Farragut’ Class battlecruiser, a vessel some 2 kilometres long. A deployment of this vessel tends to quickly end anything other than a very major military engagement.</p><p>The Federation remains driven by the corporations. Some of the most famous of them have histories entwined with the Federation. The Sirius corporation, perhaps the biggest of them all, operating out of the Sirius system, has a virtual monopoly on power generators and hyperdrive technology. Other manufacturers are famed throughout space; with names such as Core Dynamics, Lakon Spaceways, Whatt and Pritney, Durn and Resner, Faulcon DeLacy, Zorgon Peterson and Saud Kruger. These so called ‘mega-corporations’ control the birth, lives and deaths of their employees, providing for their every need and expecting absolute loyalty in return.</p><p>Technology is a major part of any federation citizen’s life, and the economy is driven by quite conspicuous (and often compulsory) consumption of new and exciting mod cons, luxuries and consumables. The society is very much ‘throwaway’ with the new and exciting replacing the ‘old and outdated’ often within months of acquisition. This drives a constant demand and supply culture, with employees spending the money they earn, further driving the success of the corporations. Strictly speaking the Federation is composed of ‘States’, in a similar manner to the U.S.A. of 21st century Earth, but on a much bigger scale. States can still be countries, but they could be entire systems. The Federation retains a presidential electoral system, but corporations influence this dramatically, expecting their employees to vote according to the corporation’s wishes. Corruption, bribery and underhanded influence are rife. Individual freedoms are suppressed in favour of profit. Greed is good.</p><p>The Federation’s capitalist model retains the economic advantages and disadvantages of its predecessors. There are many rich people, but there are many people in grinding poverty too, in such debt to the corporations that they can be regarded as wage-slaves.</p><p>"

Truly.</p>\r\n<p>I was a researcher at a facility in the Hermitage 4 A system exploring agricultural applications of Thargoid-derived technology. The lab was owned by the INRA.</p>\r\n<p>Publicly, the INRA likes to emphasise the whole altruistic and cooperative thing, but in recent years it\u2019s become much more focused on weapons testing and manufacture. Believe me, it\u2019s a military contractor in all but name.</p></blockquote>\r\n<audio controls=\"\"  src=\"https://cdn-5f3c0a05c1ac180394b62f3c.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/inra_hip15329_3of4.mp3?_=11\"></audio>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>WHISTLEBLOWER 3/4</strong><br>\r\n\u2026Bypassing security protocols\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026Secure connection established\u2026</p>\r\n<p>The nature of my field was the study of disease-resistant crops and mycoproteins, that sort of thing. I was getting good results, even if my superiors took no notice. Then everything changed.</p>\r\n<p>I was running a bunch of control experiments, just trying a few things out really. It was an afterthought \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even related to the main body of my work.</p>\r\n<p>The results were interesting and I didn\u2019t think they were particularly significant, but something made me take it directly to one of the INRA guys. I didn\u2019t want to go to Dr Prince, she\u2019d always been pretty dismissive of my work.</p>\r\n<p>I would give anything to be able to undo that decision. Anything.</p></blockquote>\r\n<audio controls=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-5f3c0a05c1ac180394b62f3c.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/inra_hip15329_4of4.mp3?_=12\"></audio>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>WHISTLEBLOWER 4/4</strong><br>\r\n\u2026Bypassing security protocols\u2026<br>\r\n\u2026Secure connection established\u2026</p>\r\n<p>All my equipment and samples were whisked off to some remote facility. Later, I found out they\u2019d been taken to a weapons-testing site in the Alnath A 2 A A system.</p>\r\n<p>My research was used as the basis of a new super weapon designed to destroy the Thargoids. I heard they experimented on live captives. I doubt any of it was strictly legal. It certainly wasn\u2019t ethical.</p>\r\n<p>To the public, the INRA is a symbol of all that is possible when superpowers set aside their differences and work together. Well, it might have started off like that, but it\u2019s something very different now. Progress at any cost, might makes right \u2013 all our worst impulses channelled into an unaccountable organisation focused solely on making bigger and more powerful weapons. Bigger and more powerful weapons. God.</p>\r\n<p>If you find this\u2026 if someone finds this, make sure it gets out. Please.

It is allegedly home to a planet of the same name that was discovered by The Dark Wheel and is said to be replete with countless Thargoid treasures. The brothers Neptune and Oberon Ryder, sons of The Dark Wheel's leader, Alex Ryder, were originally divided over whether to pursue Raxxla or Soontill and eventually discovered the latter. Despite the location of the system Soontill being known and unrestricted, the planet's whereabouts remain a mystery to all but The Dark Wheel.</p><p>Objects taken from Soontill include slabs of unidentified material covered in pictographs of unknown origin. They are exclusively sold at Cheranovsky City in the Ngurii system as the Rare Commodity Soontill Relics. These alien artefacts were confirmed by Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar to not have been made by human hands and date back tens of thousands of years.</p><p>Tourist Spot 0508 describes a base in the Soontill system where a secret Human-Thargoid project occurred.<br><blockquote>This is rumoured to be the site of the CIEP base. Some stories claim a combined Human-Thargoid project took place here.</blockquote><br><p>The acronym CIEP could mean Circle of Independent Elite Pilots, an offshoot of The Dark Wheel.They used it as a secret military base before being run off by pirates with fancy military technology. The location of Soontill was found by the pirates because it was close to Grandmort and the origin of the Circle attack force which traveled (out of their way) through Brohman and Lanaest to reach Delta Phoenicis. </p><p>The location of Soontill given by Universal Cartographics may not be the actual place, because neither it nor Ngurii are close to the Grandmort system. </p>"
